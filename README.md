# Pathfinder – AI Career Mentor (Frontend Prototype)

Pathfinder is a **frontend-only UI prototype** for an AI-powered career guidance platform.  
It demonstrates how students can interact with an AI mentor, explore structured career roadmaps, and understand their skill gaps through interactive UI components.

This project focuses on the **user experience, interface design, and logical flow** of an AI career assistant—without any backend, database, or real API integrations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This prototype showcases:

- A career-focused AI mentor interface (simulated responses)
- A dynamic roadmap generator visualizing step-by-step learning paths
- A skill gap analysis flow using mock quizzes and results
- Clean, modular UI components built with React + TypeScript
- Professional frontend architecture suitable for production-scale systems

All functionality is powered by **mock data** to preserve privacy and protect proprietary backend logic.
